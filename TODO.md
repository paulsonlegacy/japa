You're doing great—and you're asking *exactly* the right questions at the right time.

Since this is your **SaaS for global migration applications**, here's a solid next step plan (aka your **starter todo list**) that balances *progress*, *clarity*, and *scalability*—while still being small enough to not overwhelm you.

---

## **1. Setup Phase**
- [x] Choose Fiber as backend framework
- [x] Setup base project structure
- [x] Setup GORM with logging and pooling
- [x] Choose logging library (like `zap`)
- [x] Add `.env` for DB config and secrets (with something like `github.com/joho/godotenv`)
- [ ] Create base router, middleware, and Fiber app instance

---

## **2. Core Models (Start Small)**
Start with the **minimum viable data structures**. Don't overthink—build what you know now.

### Suggested Models:
- **User**  
  - ID, FullName, Email, Password (hashed), Phone, Role (admin/user), CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- **Application** (for migration requests)  
  - ID, UserID (FK), Country, VisaType, Status (pending, approved, rejected), Notes, CreatedAt
- **Credential** (optional – user details that can be reused)  
  - ID, UserID (FK), PassportNo, DOB, Nationality, Education, WorkHistory, etc.

Down the line:
- Payment Model  
- DocumentUpload Model  
- Notification Model (for real-time updates)

But for now, just **start with `User` and `Application`**. That’s enough to test login, create a migration request, and manage statuses.

## **3. Build Auth System**
- [ ] Register
- [ ] Login (JWT)
- [ ] Middleware for route protection (JWT parsing)
- [ ] Role check middleware

---

## **4. CRUD for Core Models**
- [ ] Create application
- [ ] View applications (all/one)
- [ ] Update application status (admin only)
- [ ] Delete application (maybe soft delete)

---

## **5. Docs + Maintenance**
- [ ] Write meaningful `README.md` with setup, endpoints, tech stack
- [ ] Add `Makefile` commands for ease
- [ ] Setup Swagger or Postman collection for testing
- [ ] Plan for testing (unit + integration later)

---

### Optional Nice-to-Have (Park for Later):
- WebSocket notification (when status updates)
- Admin dashboard
- Export to PDF
- Email integration

---

## **TL;DR: Your next focus?**
1. Start with basic `User` and `Application` model
2. Create simple migrations
3. Build user registration and login
4. Add `create application` endpoint

If you want, I can generate the `User` and `Application` models + sample migration code now, so you can hit the ground running. Want that?
