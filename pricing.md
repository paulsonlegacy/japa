Now since you know about the project in details, what can you suggest for the payment model? What I had in mind was only for visa application which attracts a one-time fee but for the other features, a subscription based payment mode seem better or more comformable since tailored email and notification of updates is a regular thing not one time.. although the subscription can also include multiple or unlimited visa applications in a month. Or do users choose from a range of plans?? What do you suggest? Note that the goal is to make it affordable for the regular user while also generating steady income to fund our japa goals too and the team. Also the plans should be able to fund our collaborators (japa consultants and influencers) so everyone is happy at the end of the day

Here's a flexible and fair payment model that could work well:

### **1. Hybrid Pricing Model (One-time + Subscription)**

#### **A. One-Time Payment (Visa Application Service)**

* Flat, affordable fee per visa application.
* This suits users who want to try out the platform without long-term commitment.
* Add-ons (e.g., express handling, resume review, document editing) can be charged separately.

#### **B. Subscription Tiers (Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly)**

> Great for power users and loyal followers who want value-added features continuously.

| Plan        | Price (Est.) | Includes                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**    | \$0          | Blog access, AI assessment (1 time), public japa news                                                 |
| **Starter** | \$5-10/month | AI advisor (unlimited), visa tracking, 1 visa app/month, opportunity alerts                           |
| **Pro**     | \$20/month   | All of Starter + 3 visa apps/month, priority support, resume reviews                                  |
| **Elite**   | \$50/month   | All of Pro + unlimited visa apps, mentorship access, early job/school alerts, premium travel insights |

* **Note:** You can offer discounted annual billing and include a 7-day trial for higher tiers.

### **2. Revenue Sharing for Collaborators**

* Create a **partner dashboard** for consultants & influencers.
* Give each a **referral/affiliate link** or code.
* Pay them **commission per subscription sign-up** or per service they render (e.g., mentorship or SOP writing).
* You could allow them to **price their own services** within your platform while taking a small fee from each transaction.

---

### **3. Upsell Opportunities**

* **After visa approval**, prompt users with:

  * Discounted flight comparison tools
  * Accommodation partner deals
  * Local guides/resources for new immigrants

---

### **4. Smart Usage Metering (Optional but powerful)**

* For example: “You’ve used 2 of 3 visa applications this month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited access.”
* Encourages **frequent users to upgrade** organically.

---

### **Final Suggestion**

Start with fewer plans — maybe **Free, Starter, and Pro**. You can scale to Elite later once you have established your authority and value. Also consider **student-friendly pricing** or **local pricing models** based on geolocation (especially for African users).
